- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alviestor
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code and building applciations for my personal use
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# Dot Net coding by building Native App for Windows Platform
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything actually.
- 📫 You can reach me via Github
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being in my 50s, I still get a thrill from coding like I did in my younger days. One of my favorite coding rituals involves staying up late into the night, fueled by endless cups of chai, crafting applications for my personal use. It's my own little world of digital tinkering, where age is just a number and the lines of code are my playground.
